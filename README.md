# Text-Compression
Text compression using Huffman Coding; enhanced using Burrows-Wheeler Transforms and other algorithms.

Compressor program opens and reads a file named “comp.txt” placed in the same folder as the executable “a.out” and generates a compressed file named “compi.bin”.

Decompressor programs opens and reads a file named “compi.bin” that was previously created by the compressor program and decompresses it into a text file, named “decomp.txt” by default, in the same folder as the executable “a.out”.

This project was done as part of a “Data Structures” course in an Undergraduate program.
